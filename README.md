  ### As a facilitator, your role will be to accompany the teams during the 2h30 workshop.

  You need to:

  * an internet connection
  * a video projector
  * (optional) [Story cubes](https://fr.asmodee.com/fr/games/story-cubes/) 
  
  ## Step 1: Explain the rules
  
  **READ**
  *As a team you will have to write a story. Each participant will have to write 2 sentences.
  You have 5 minutes to agree on the story to tell and share who should write which part.
  You should not talk about how you will organize yourself on the repository. (You can use _Story cubes_ to generate the story)
  I must be able to find the author of each sentence.
  The story must be consistent and respect the concordance of time.*
  
  
  ## Step 2: Split the team
  
  Make sure that the participants of the same team are positioned as far as possible in the room. They must not see what is displayed on their colleague's PC.

  **READ** 
  *You must not communicate with others by any means. You can only communicate through the Github interface.*
  
  ## Step 3: Simmer for a maximum of 45 minutes
  
  Let them do as they can for a maximum of 45 minutes. They should normally encounter several problems.
  If the team is doing well, introduce a new rule after 20 minutes.

  **READ**
  *You must write a back cover in another file*
  
  Take notes on what went wrong.
  
  ## Step 4: Debrief with the team
  
  You must look at the branches of the git tree. Talk about the problems encountered.

  Let the team propose methods that would avoid worries. If the team has no ideas, suggest your ideas.
  
  - Always start on a branch
  - Use PR to let your friend read your content
  - Use Merge, Rebase 
  
  
  ## Step 5: Starting from the beginning, this time it's the right one.
  
  All in the title.
